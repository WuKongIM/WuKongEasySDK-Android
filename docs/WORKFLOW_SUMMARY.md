- Failure notifications with troubleshooting hints

## 🎯 Trigger Mechanisms

### 1. Automatic Tag-Based Triggers
```bash
# Create and push version tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**Supported Tag Patterns**:
- `v1.0.0` - Stable release
- `v1.0.0-beta.1` - Pre-release
- `v2.0.0-alpha.3` - Pre-release
- `v1.0.0-rc.1` - Release candidate

### 2. Manual Workflow Dispatch
**Use Cases**:
- Testing workflow changes
- Emergency releases
- Dry run validation

**Parameters**:
- **Version**: Manual version specification
- **Dry Run**: Build without publishing

## 🛠️ Local Testing Tools

### Verification Script
```bash
# Check local environment setup
./scripts/verify-publishing-setup.sh
```

**Checks**:
- Java JDK 17+ installation
- Android SDK configuration
- Git setup and credentials
- GPG key availability
- Gradle wrapper functionality
- Project structure validation
- Network connectivity

### Workflow Test Script
```bash
# Simulate workflow steps locally
./scripts/test-workflow.sh
```

**Simulates**:
- Build and test processes
- Artifact generation
- GPG signing tests
- Publishing configuration
- Network connectivity

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### 1. GPG Signing Failures
**Symptoms**: `gpg: signing failed`
**Solutions**:
- Verify GPG_PRIVATE_KEY secret is correctly base64 encoded
- Check SIGNING_PASSWORD matches GPG key passphrase
- Ensure SIGNING_KEY_ID is correct 8-character hex value

#### 2. Maven Central Authentication
**Symptoms**: `401 Unauthorized`
**Solutions**:
- Verify OSSRH_USERNAME and OSSRH_PASSWORD secrets
- Confirm Sonatype account has access to com.wukongim group
- Check account is not suspended or requires reactivation

#### 3. Build Failures
**Symptoms**: Tests or compilation errors
**Solutions**:
- Run local verification: `./scripts/test-workflow.sh`
- Check build locally: `./gradlew clean build`
- Review dependency versions and compatibility

#### 4. Network Issues
**Symptoms**: Connection timeouts or DNS failures
**Solutions**:
- Check GitHub Actions service status
- Verify Maven Central and Sonatype OSSRH availability
- Review proxy settings if applicable

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Local environment check
./scripts/verify-publishing-setup.sh

# Workflow simulation
./scripts/test-workflow.sh

# Manual GPG test
echo "test" | gpg --clearsign

# Gradle dependency check
./gradlew dependencies --configuration releaseRuntimeClasspath
```

## 📈 Performance Optimizations
